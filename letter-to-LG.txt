Dear L.
Thanks for yours of this morning. I hope 
you have had my card posted last Monday. 
On Mond. next I lecture the Field Club - 
a Nat. Hist. Association, in the lines of our 
old Society - Geological, (you + me) + Botanical 
(New) Do you remember: you old 
Black Molt? Well, the days have 
come when I am one of the founders of a real 
 learned society. My oubject has 
the rather journalese Title of "Do Plants 
Think?" - a study of the Response to 
Stimuli + Devices for Fertilisation, 
etc. I have no books yet, but I 
remember a number of useful points 
from your big Cassets' (I think it was 
Cassets') studied a 1911. Meanwhile 


I'm beastly bothered with our Mag. 
(herewith) and I'm {take} German 
Lessons at the Berlitz, Edin. 
Last week I wrote (to order) a strong 
bit of Blank: on Antaeus v. Heracles. 
These are the best lines, methinks: 
(N.B. Antaeus deriving strength from his Mother Earth 
nearly licked old Herk.) 
... How Earth herself empowered him with her trick,
Gave him the grip and stringency of Winter,
And all the ardour of th' invincible Spring;
How all the blood of June glutted his heart,
And all the glow of huge autumnal storms
Stirred on his face, and flickered from his eyes.
 I had seen your Song. May the music 
be equally happy. you are lucky!
 you shall have my Locke's "Usurper" if you 
will. Its now at home. 
 I see Swinburne also wrote a number of 
replicas of the olde Ballad! Heigh ho! 
Ever yours
WEO
